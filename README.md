RESTFul API with Symfony2
=========================

Base project structure and dependencies for creating a completely separated RestFul API
that can be used with a RestFul frontend module for creating complex scalable projects.

ToDo List
---------

1. Integrate [BazingaHateoasBundle](https://github.com/willdurand/BazingaHateoasBundle/) in order to allow complete REST support
-2. Create a base version of this setup that we can use for all future projects-
3. Replace EC with Around25
4. Handle file uploads through the API
5. Check full integration with NG RESTFul Frontend.
6. Integrate RabbitMq, Redis and SendGrid.
